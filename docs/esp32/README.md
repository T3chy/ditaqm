# Embedded, low cost, ESP32 Air Quality Cluster
## What more could you ask for?


## Welcome!
Below are the steps to set up your very own ESP32-based DIYAQI sensor cluster board!

To get a cluster board up and running, you have two options:

[Purchase a Pre-Built board (and support a high school air quality club!)](#pre-built)

[Build it from scratch (don't worry! It's not as hard as it might sound :))](#from-scratch)


## From Scratch!

### Step 1: Ordering the Components and PCBs
I have used [LCSC](https://lcsc.com) for the components and [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) for the PCBs during development, but there is nothing in the source files that will only work with those distributors. If you want the easiest possible experience, use either Mouser or LCSC for your components, because I have included distributor-specific part numbers for them in the BOM. Ok, let's get ordering!

#### Ordering the components
This will be a guide for ordering the components on LCSC, it is probably similar on any other major components distributor with a BOM tool.

1. Head over to [lcsc](https://lcsc.com) and click on BOM Tool

2. Download the [BOM](../../boards/esp32/hardware/pcb/bom.csv) and upload it to the site
